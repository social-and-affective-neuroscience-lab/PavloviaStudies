This task is aimed to study how participants' choices may change as a function of an imagined audience. When making decisions between playing a videogame and completing standardized questions, participants are primed with the name of an academic mentor, a close friend, and a celebrity, such that moralizing these decisions may govern choices to complete certain actions.
